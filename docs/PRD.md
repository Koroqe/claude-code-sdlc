# Product Requirements Document

This document captures feature requirements for the Claude Code SDLC project. Each feature gets a numbered section. Sections are append-only -- do not remove completed features, mark them as `[SHIPPED]` instead.

## 1. Pipeline Hardening — Verification, Deviation Rules, Executable Plans

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Priority:** High

### 1.1 Description

Add four mechanisms to the Claude Code SDLC pipeline that address gaps in verification depth, error handling intelligence, plan precision, and scope integrity in the current v2.1.0 setup.

**Why:** The current pipeline verifies that code compiles and tests pass, but does not verify that features are actually wired together and functional end-to-end. Error recovery is a flat retry loop with no categorization. Implementation plans allow vague slice descriptions that cause interpretation drift. The Plan Critic does not detect scope reduction -- where an implementer silently downgrades a feature from what the PRD specifies.

### 1.2 User Story

As a developer using the Claude Code SDLC pipeline, I want the agents to catch wiring gaps before merge, recover from errors intelligently based on severity, produce unambiguous implementation plans, and flag scope reduction during planning -- so that features ship complete and correct on the first pass.

### 1.3 Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Goal-Backward Verification (new `verifier` agent)

A new agent (`verifier`) that verifies features actually work by checking four levels of integration, not just compilation and test passage.

1. **FR-1.1:** The `verifier` agent MUST check **Level 1 -- File Existence**: all files referenced in the implementation plan exist on disk.
2. **FR-1.2:** The `verifier` agent MUST check **Level 2 -- No Stubs/Placeholders**: no file contains TODO, FIXME, placeholder, stub, or "not implemented" markers in production code paths (test files excluded).
3. **FR-1.3:** The `verifier` agent MUST check **Level 3 -- Wiring**: exports are imported where expected, routes are registered in the router, components are rendered in their parent, middleware is applied to relevant endpoints.
4. **FR-1.4:** The `verifier` agent MUST check **Level 4 -- Data Flow**: real data paths are connected end-to-end (e.g., a form submission reaches the API handler, the handler calls the service, the service calls the database layer).
5. **FR-1.5:** The `verifier` agent MUST produce a structured report with PASS/FAIL per level and specific findings for each failure.
6. **FR-1.6:** The `verifier` agent MUST be wired into `/merge-ready` as a new gate (Gate 5.5, between E2E Tests and Documentation Accuracy -- or renumbered appropriately).
7. **FR-1.7:** The `verifier` agent prompt MUST be a standalone markdown file at `src/agents/verifier.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`) matching the existing agent format.
8. **FR-1.8:** The agent table in `src/claude.md` MUST include the `verifier` agent with its role and responsibility.

#### FR-2: Deviation Rules (augmented error recovery)

Replace the flat "retry 3 times" error recovery strategy with graduated autonomy rules that categorize errors by severity and prescribe specific responses.

1. **FR-2.1:** **Rule 1 -- Auto-fix typos and imports.** When a typecheck or build error is caused by a typo, missing import, wrong import path, or unused import, the agent MUST fix it automatically without counting toward the retry budget.
2. **FR-2.2:** **Rule 2 -- Auto-add missing validation/error handling.** When a code review or security audit flags missing input validation, missing error handling, or missing null checks, the agent MUST add the fix automatically without counting toward the retry budget.
3. **FR-2.3:** **Rule 3 -- Auto-resolve dependency/config issues.** When a build fails due to a missing dependency, wrong version, or misconfigured environment variable, the agent MUST attempt resolution (install dependency, fix config) automatically. This counts as 1 retry attempt.
4. **FR-2.4:** **Rule 4 -- Escalate architectural decisions.** When a failure requires changing module boundaries, altering the public API surface, modifying database schemas beyond what the plan specifies, or making a design tradeoff, the agent MUST stop and escalate to the user with a clear description of the decision needed, the options available, and the tradeoffs of each.
5. **FR-2.5:** The existing mid-slice verification behavior (typecheck after every 3 file edits when a slice touches 4+ files) MUST be preserved unchanged.
6. **FR-2.6:** The retry budget (max 3 retries before escalation) MUST still apply to Rule 3 and Rule 4 categories. Rules 1 and 2 are "free" fixes that do not consume retries.
7. **FR-2.7:** `src/rules/error-recovery.md` MUST contain all four deviation rules with clear error categorization examples for each rule.

#### FR-3: Executable Plan Format (planner output)

Require the planner agent to produce slices with structured, machine-readable fields that eliminate interpretation drift during implementation.

1. **FR-3.1:** Each slice in the planner's output MUST include a `Files:` field listing exact file paths (existing files verified via Glob, new files marked `[new]`).
2. **FR-3.2:** Each slice MUST include a `Changes:` field describing the specific change to make in each listed file (not just "update X" but "add function Y that does Z" or "register route /api/foo in the router").
3. **FR-3.3:** Each slice MUST include a `Verify:` field containing the exact shell command(s) to run for verification (e.g., `npm run typecheck && npm test -- --grep "feature-name"`).
4. **FR-3.4:** Each slice MUST include a `Done when:` field with a testable boolean condition (e.g., "GET /api/users returns 200 with a JSON array" -- not "users endpoint works").
5. **FR-3.5:** The planner agent prompt (`src/agents/planner.md`) MUST be updated to require this format in its Output Format section.
6. **FR-3.6:** The `/implement-slice` command (`src/commands/implement-slice.md`) MUST be updated so that "Identify the Slice" reads the `Files:`, `Changes:`, `Verify:`, and `Done when:` fields directly from the plan instead of restating the slice in prose.

#### FR-4: Scope Reduction Detection (Plan Critic enhancement)

Add a new check to the Plan Critic that detects hedging language indicating the implementer is silently reducing scope below what the PRD specifies.

1. **FR-4.1:** The Plan Critic MUST scan all slice descriptions, done-conditions, and implementation notes for hedging language including but not limited to: "v1", "basic version", "simplified", "placeholder", "for now", "future enhancement", "out of scope for now", "minimal implementation", "stubbed out", "hardcoded for now".
2. **FR-4.2:** When hedging language is found AND the corresponding feature is marked as in-scope in the PRD, the critic MUST flag it as a **MAJOR** finding with the category "Scope Reduction".
3. **FR-4.3:** The finding MUST identify the specific hedging phrase, the slice where it appears, and the PRD requirement it violates.
4. **FR-4.4:** The Plan Critic prompt in `src/claude.md` MUST include the Scope Reduction Detection check as a named section under the critic's checks.

### 1.4 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1:** All changes are markdown prompt files only. There is no runtime code in this project -- no JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or shell scripts are modified (except `install.sh` if the new agent file needs to be included in the install manifest).
2. **NFR-2:** All changes MUST be backward compatible with the existing pipeline. Projects already using Claude Code SDLC v2.1.0 MUST continue to function after upgrading. No existing agent, command, or rule behavior is removed -- only augmented.
3. **NFR-3:** Changes take effect on the next Claude Code session after re-install (`bash install.sh`). No migration steps required beyond re-running the installer.
4. **NFR-4:** The `verifier` agent MUST use the `sonnet` model (consistent with other verification agents like `build-runner`) to keep costs proportional to the task.
5. **NFR-5:** The total agent count increases from 12 to 13. All references to "12 agents" in `README.md` and `src/claude.md` MUST be updated to 13.

### 1.5 Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1:** A file `src/agents/verifier.md` exists with valid frontmatter (`name: verifier`, `description`, `tools`, `model`) and a prompt that implements the 4-level verification described in FR-1.1 through FR-1.4.
2. **AC-2:** `src/commands/merge-ready.md` contains a new gate that delegates to the `verifier` agent. The gate's checklist references all four verification levels. The gate appears in the output format table.
3. **AC-3:** `src/rules/error-recovery.md` contains four numbered deviation rules matching FR-2.1 through FR-2.4. Each rule includes at least two concrete error examples. The mid-slice verification section is preserved verbatim.
4. **AC-4:** `src/agents/planner.md` Output Format section requires `Files:`, `Changes:`, `Verify:`, and `Done when:` fields per slice. The existing constraints section is preserved.
5. **AC-5:** `src/commands/implement-slice.md` "Identify the Slice" step references the executable plan fields (`Files:`, `Changes:`, `Verify:`, `Done when:`) and uses them directly.
6. **AC-6:** The Plan Critic prompt in `src/claude.md` includes a "Scope Reduction Detection" check that scans for hedging language and flags MAJOR findings when in-scope features are reduced.
7. **AC-7:** The agent table in `src/claude.md` includes a row for the `verifier` agent with role "Verification Engineer" and responsibility description.
8. **AC-8:** `README.md` references to "12 agents" are updated to "13 agents". The agent table in the README includes the `verifier` agent. The pipeline diagram in the README shows the verifier gate in the `/merge-ready` section.
9. **AC-9:** All cross-references between agents, commands, and rules are valid -- no agent is referenced that does not have a corresponding `.md` file, no command references a gate that does not exist, no rule references behavior that is not implemented in the relevant agent or command.

### 1.10 Risks and Dependencies

1. **Risk: Verifier false positives.** The Level 2 check (no stubs/placeholders) may flag legitimate uses of TODO in documentation or comments. Mitigation: scope the check to production code paths only, exclude test files and markdown documentation.
2. **Risk: Hedging language false positives.** Terms like "v1" or "basic" may appear in legitimate PRD descriptions of intentionally scoped features. Mitigation: the critic only flags hedging language as MAJOR when the PRD explicitly marks the feature as in-scope and the plan is reducing it.
3. **Risk: Executable plan format verbosity.** Requiring `Files:`, `Changes:`, `Verify:`, `Done when:` per slice increases planner output length. Mitigation: the planner already produces detailed slices; this structures existing content rather than adding new content.
4. **Risk: install.sh manifest.** The new `src/agents/verifier.md` file must be included in the install script's file copy list. If `install.sh` uses a glob pattern for `src/agents/*.md`, no change is needed. If it has an explicit file list, it must be updated.
5. **Dependency: No external dependencies.** All changes are self-contained within the project's markdown files.
